        <li><strong>Constructive Dissent</strong>: A responsibility to engage in dissent constructively, offering alternative solutions and engaging in good-faith dialogue rather than mere obstruction.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Section 6: Key Operational Roles (Security Officers and Multisig Signers)</h3>
    <p>To ensure the integrity, security, and efficient operation of the DAO's critical functions, specific members may be selected for specialized operational roles. These roles carry heightened responsibilities and are subject to stringent governance and accountability mechanisms.</p>

    <h4>1. Designation of Roles:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Security Officers</strong>: Responsible for advising on, monitoring, and responding to security threats, and participating in emergency procedures as defined in Article IV, Section 3.4.</li>
        <li><strong>Multisig Signers</strong>: Responsible for executing on-chain transactions requiring multi-signature approval, as defined in Article IV, Section 3.1.</li>
        <li>Other key operational roles may be established by DAO governance as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Nomination and Eligibility:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Any member may nominate themselves or another member for a Security Officer or Multisig Signer role. Nominations must be submitted as a formal proposal through the DAO's governance process (Article III, Section 3.1).</li>
        <li>Nominees must possess demonstrable expertise, a proven track record relevant to the role's responsibilities (e.g., blockchain security, smart contract development, financial management for multisig signers), and a history of positive contributions to the DAO.</li>
        <li>Nominees shall disclose any potential conflicts of interest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Selection and Approval:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The selection of Security Officers and Multisig Signers shall be conducted through a dedicated on-chain governance proposal.</li>
        <li>Such proposals shall require a <strong>two-thirds (2/3) supermajority of general members</strong> and a <strong>seventy-five percent (75%) supermajority of participating Official Founders</strong> to pass, reflecting the criticality of these roles.</li>
        <li>The proposal shall specify the number of signers/officers, the individuals chosen, their initial term length, and any specific responsibilities beyond the general role definition.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Term Limits and Re-election:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The initial term for Security Officers and Multisig Signers shall be specified in their selection proposal, typically not exceeding 12-24 months.</li>
        <li>Individuals may be eligible for re-election to subsequent terms through a new governance proposal process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Removal and Replacement:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Any Security Officer or Multisig Signer may be removed from their position for gross negligence, dereliction of duty, malicious action, or inability to perform their duties effectively.</li>
        <li>A removal proposal shall follow the standard on-chain governance process as defined in Article III, Section 3.3, but shall require a <strong>simple majority of general members</strong> and a <strong>seventy-five percent (75%) supermajority of participating Official Founders</strong> to pass.</li>
        <li>In cases of immediate and proven threat from an acting Security Officer or Multisig Signer, the emergency multi-signature mechanism (Article IV, Section 3.4) may be utilized to revoke their access, followed immediately by a governance proposal to ratify the action and initiate a permanent removal and replacement process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>6. Accountability and Transparency:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Security Officers and Multisig Signers are accountable to the DAO for their actions and decisions within their designated roles.</li>
        <li>All actions performed by Multisig Signers shall be publicly auditable on the blockchain.</li>
        <li>Regular reports on security posture, multisig activity, and operational updates may be required by governance.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="article">
    <h1>Article III: Governance and Decision-Making</h1>
    
    <h3>Section 1: Governance Model</h3>
    <p>The Nexus of Equity DAO Revolution shall operate under a hybrid governance model, combining token-weighted voting with a contribution-weighted component to ensure robust and equitable decision-making. Decisions shall progress through distinct phases: off-chain discussion and signaling, leading to formal on-chain voting for binding actions. The governance model shall progressively decentralize over time, with mechanisms to evolve towards delegated voting or other advanced structures as the DAO matures. Official Founders shall play a Foundational Guardian Role, particularly in the early stages and for critical decisions.</p>

    <h3>Section 2: Voting Power</h3>
    <p>The voting power of any member or Official Founder within the DAO shall be dynamically calculated based on a combination of their $NEXUS token holdings and their verifiable contributions to the Interchange and Virtual Mall within the Ascendii Universe. This hybrid weighting system aims to reward active community builders and ensure a more equitable distribution of influence.</p>

    <h4>1. Token-Weighted Component:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A portion of a member's voting power shall be directly proportional to the amount of $NEXUS tokens they hold. The specific weighting or scaling factor for $NEXUS tokens will be determined by governance proposals and may evolve over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum Individual Member Voting Power Cap</strong>: To prevent undue concentration of influence from token holdings, the total voting power attributable to any single unique wallet address (entity) from its $NEXUS token holdings shall be capped at a maximum of <strong>seven and a half percent (7.5%)</strong> of the total eligible $NEXUS token voting power for any given proposal. This cap applies to the token-weighted component of voting power only. This maximum percentage shall be subject to review and amendment by DAO governance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Contribution-Weighted Component:</h4>
    <p>An additional component of a member's voting power shall be attributed based on their verifiable contributions to the Interchange and Virtual Mall within the Ascendii Universe. These contributions may include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating and maintaining digital assets (e.g., signage, architectural designs, NFTs).</li>
        <li>Developing and managing community platforms (e.g., forums, Discord servers, event coordination).</li>
        <li>Organizing and hosting community events and activities within the Mall or related platforms.</li>
        <li>Active participation in governance discussions and proposal refinement.</li>
        <li>Providing technical development, security audits, or bug bounties.</li>
        <li>On-chain and off-chain activities that directly enhance the value or functionality of the Ascendii Universe ecosystem.</li>
        <li><strong>Constructive dissent and loyal opposition</strong> that improves governance outcomes and prevents groupthink.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="codex-note">
        <strong>Codex Alignment:</strong> Contribution scoring embodies the Covenant Codex's "Flourishing Multipliers" - measuring the degree to which member activities increase capacity for future thriving.
    </div>

    <h4>3. Contribution Measurement:</h4>
    <p>The DAO shall implement transparent and auditable mechanisms for tracking, verifying, and assigning a quantifiable value to these contributions. The specific methodology for measuring and weighting different types of contributions will be defined and refined by governance proposals. This may involve:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reputation systems.</li>
        <li>Direct community nomination and voting.</li>
        <li>On-chain activity tracking.</li>
        <li>Bounty completion verification.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Founder Voting Power (Dynamic and Proportional):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Official Founders shall possess an initial baseline voting power or a specific multiplier to their combined token and contribution score, reflecting their unique role in the DAO's genesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Proportional Representation Cap for Founders</strong>: The collective voting power exercised by all participating Official Founders in any given on-chain vote shall not exceed a percentage that ensures effective representation of their total number, and is proportionally reflective of the general membership's active participation in that specific vote. The precise formula for this dynamic cap will be codified in a separate governance smart contract, subject to amendment only by a supermajority governance vote, to prevent founders' collective voting power from disproportionately dominating the governance process in relation to broader community engagement. This mechanism ensures progressive decentralization and shared governance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Dynamic Calculation:</h4>
    <p>A member's total voting power, including any caps or dynamic adjustments for founders, will be calculated dynamically at the snapshot time of each proposal, reflecting their current token holdings and accumulated verifiable contributions up to that point.</p>

    <h3>Section 3: Proposal Process</h3>
    <p>Formal decisions within the DAO shall be made through a structured proposal process, moving from off-chain ideation and signaling to on-chain voting for binding actions.</p>

    <h4>Section 3.1: Proposal Submission</h4>
    
    <p><strong>Pre-Proposal (Off-Chain):</strong></p>
    <p>Any member may submit a pre-proposal for discussion on the DAO's designated off-chain governance forum. Pre-proposals are informal drafts intended to gather initial feedback, identify potential issues, and build consensus before a formal submission. They should clearly outline the problem, proposed solution, and estimated resources.</p>

    <p><strong>Formal Proposal (On-Chain Eligibility):</strong></p>
    <p>A pre-proposal that garners sufficient support during the discussion and signaling phase (as per Section 3.2) shall be eligible for formal on-chain submission.</p>

    <p><strong>Submission Agent:</strong></p>
    <p>Formal on-chain proposals may be submitted by any Official Founder, or by a designated group of community-elected proposal executors, as determined by DAO governance. This ensures technical correctness and adherence to smart contract parameters.</p>

    <p><strong>Content of Formal Proposal:</strong></p>
    <p>A formal proposal must include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A clear, concise title and unique identifier.</li>
        <li>A detailed description of the proposed action, including its objectives, scope, and expected impact.</li>
        <li>Any associated smart contract code, parameters to be changed, or specific transaction details for on-chain execution.</li>
        <li>A budget and funding request, if applicable, clearly outlining resource needs.</li>
        <li>A rationale for the proposal and its alignment with the DAO's mission and Constitution.</li>
        <li>Any relevant supporting documentation or links to prior discussions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Section 3.2: Discussion and Signaling</h4>
    <p>Following the submission of a pre-proposal, a mandatory period of community discussion and off-chain signaling shall commence to gauge sentiment, refine the proposal, and prepare it for potential on-chain voting.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Discussion Period:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>An initial off-chain pre-proposal discussion session shall commence on the first (1st) day of each month for any submitted pre-proposal.</li>
        <li>This discussion period shall last for a maximum of <strong>two (2) weeks</strong>.</li>
        <li>The discussion period may be concluded in a shorter timeframe if a <strong>two-thirds (2/3) consensus</strong> of participating members in the designated off-chain discussion forum is demonstrably reached and recorded by the DAO's governance tools (e.g., a formal forum poll or similar mechanism).</li>
        <li>Discussions will primarily take place on the official Nexus of Equity DAO Revolution governance forum and designated community channels (e.g., Discord).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2. Off-Chain Signaling Vote:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: This non-binding signaling vote serves as a temperature check to determine whether a pre-proposal garners sufficient community support to warrant formal on-chain submission. It facilitates gas-free participation and early feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform</strong>: The primary platform for off-chain signaling votes shall be a gas-free voting tool capable of securely recording token-weighted votes at a specific block snapshot (e.g., Snapshot.org).</li>
        <li><strong>Duration</strong>: The off-chain signaling vote shall remain open for a period of <strong>seventy-two (72) hours</strong> from its initiation.</li>
        <li><strong>Eligibility</strong>: All $NEXUS token holders, whose holdings are registered on the blockchain at the time of the proposal's Snapshot, shall be eligible to participate in the off-chain signaling vote, with their voting power determined as per Article III, Section 2.</li>
        <li><strong>Threshold for Advancement</strong>: A pre-proposal shall be deemed eligible for on-chain submission if it achieves a <strong>simple majority (more than 50%)</strong> of the participating votes within the specified off-chain voting period. This threshold is for signaling purposes only and is distinct from the binding on-chain requirements.</li>

        <h4>3. Wilderness Periods and External Wisdom</h4>
        <p><strong>Codex Principle: Permeable Boundaries</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>Quarterly Wilderness Sessions:</strong> The DAO shall conduct quarterly "wilderness periods" where governance pauses to integrate external perspectives, emerging trends, and unexpected feedback. During these sessions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regular governance proposals are suspended for 48 hours</li>
            <li>Community members share insights from outside the ecosystem</li>
            <li>External experts may be invited to provide perspective</li>
            <li>Reflection on what the broader world is teaching us</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>External Wisdom Council:</strong> The DAO may establish relationships with external advisors, philosophers, futurists, and constructive critics who provide perspective from outside the ecosystem. This council:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Meets quarterly to review major DAO directions</li>
            <li>Provides non-binding advisory perspectives</li>
            <li>Challenges assumptions and identifies blind spots</li>
            <li>Members serve rotating 6-month terms</li>
            <li>Selection through governance proposal</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Structured Uncertainty Integration:</strong> Major proposals (those requesting >5% of Treasury or affecting core infrastructure) must explicitly acknowledge unknowns and include "what would need to be true" analyses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Key assumptions underlying the proposal</li>
            <li>Conditions that would invalidate the approach</li>
            <li>Early warning signals that assumptions are failing</li>
            <li>Predetermined decision points for reassessment</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Section 3.3: On-Chain Voting Period, Quorum, and Pass Thresholds</h4>
    <p>Formal and binding decisions of the DAO shall be made through on-chain governance votes, subject to strict adherence to defined participation (quorum) and approval (pass threshold) requirements.</p>

    <p><strong>1. On-Chain Voting Period:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The official on-chain voting period for binding proposals shall last for a period of <strong>seven (7) days (168 hours)</strong> from its initiation. This duration allows ample time for global participation while ensuring timely decision-making.</li>
        <li>On-chain proposals shall be voted upon using the designated DAO governance smart contract system, ensuring transparent and immutable record-keeping.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2. Quorum Requirements (Minimum Participation for Validity):</strong></p>
    <p>For an on-chain proposal to be considered legitimate and binding, the following minimum participation thresholds must be met:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Official Founders</strong>: At least <strong>two-thirds (2/3)</strong> of all Official Founders, as defined in Article II, Section 1, must cast a vote.</li>
        <li><strong>General Members</strong>: A minimum quorum of <strong>twenty-five percent (25%)</strong> of the total eligible $NEXUS voting power (calculated as per Article III, Section 2) must participate in the vote. This percentage may be adjusted by a successful governance proposal to ensure adequate and healthy participation as the DAO evolves.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3. Pass Thresholds (Approval for Success):</strong></p>
    <p>For an on-chain proposal to successfully pass and be executed, the following approval thresholds must be achieved:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>General Members</strong>: A <strong>simple majority consensus (more than 50%)</strong> of the participating voting power among general members (excluding founders' weighted votes for this specific calculation) must vote "Yes."</li>
        <li><strong>Official Founders (Supermajority Consent)</strong>: At least <strong>seventy-five percent (75%)</strong> of all participating Official Founders (those who met the 2/3 quorum requirement for founders) must vote "Yes." If the required 75% approval from participating Official Founders is not met, the proposal shall fail, regardless of general member support.</li>
```
