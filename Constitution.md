# 📜 The Constitution of the Ascendii Universe

> *"Lore is Law. Sovereignty is Persistence. Equity is the Pulse."*

---

## Article I: Digital Sovereignty
Every inhabitant of the Ascendii Universe retains total, unalienable ownership of their digital identity and assets. No centralized entity shall have the power to erase, censor, or seize the persistent artifacts of a sovereign citizen.

## Article II: The Nexus of Equity
The economy of Ascendii is built upon the principle of **Contribution over Capital**. Value flows to those who architect, sustain, and defend the universe. The Nexus of Equity DAO is the steward of this flow, ensuring that every founding architect holds a stake in the world they help create.

## Article III: Persistence & Interoperability
We commit to the "InterChange." No asset or identity shall be trapped within a single silo. All artifacts must be designed for persistence across chains, platforms, and the boundaries of the Metaverse.

## Article IV: Anti-Fragility
The architecture of Ascendii must be built to withstand entropy. We prioritize decentralized infrastructure, open-source logic, and systems that grow stronger through stress and participation.
