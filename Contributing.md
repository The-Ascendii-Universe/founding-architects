# Contributing to Founding Architects

We are building the reputation primitives for the entire Ascendii Universe — every line of code, every idea, and every review matters.

We follow a **meritocratic 5-tier contribution path**. Every meaningful contribution moves you up and is permanently recorded on-chain (ULIQ reputation + future sigil upgrades).

## The 5 Tiers

| Tier       | Title            | How to Reach                                                                 | On-chain Reward                     |
|------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|

| 2          | Seeker           | Open a meaningful Discussion or Issue                                         | 50 ULIQ + Explorer badge            |
| 3          | Guardian         | Comment, triage issues, help others                                           | 200 ULIQ + Guardian role            |
| 4          | Builder          | Merged PR (documentation, tests, minor features)                              | 1 000–5 000 ULIQ + Builder sigil    |
| 5          | Architect        | Major features, protocol design, long-term maintenance                       | Founding Architect consideration + equity-level tokens |
